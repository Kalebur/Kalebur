# Hi, I'm James! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a web developer with a passion for building interactive user experiences. I have a strong skillset in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always working on courses or reading books to improve my existing skills and develop new ones.

I'm also extremely interested in game development, both the art and coding side of things, and am currently learning the Unity game engine and Blender for creating art assets.

### Currently Learning
